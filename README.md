# ToDoList

This is my implementation of the popular ToDoList application. The main technologies I chose for this project are Django, React and Aiogram. In the photos below you can see in detail how this project works and how you can run it yourself.

# Usage

Check the backend, frontend and bot directories. Each of them has its own README.md with detailed instructions for launching.

Also note that the bot and frontend are not connected in any way, but both of them cannot work without a running backend
