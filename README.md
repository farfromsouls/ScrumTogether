# ToDoList

This is my implementation of the popular ToDoList application. The main technologies I chose for this project are Django, React and Aiogram. In the photos below you can see in detail how this project works and how you can run it yourself.

# Usage

Be sure you've installed NodeJs with npm manager and python version 3.11 or newer.

Go to the backend project directory and use this commands
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Then in other console move to the frontend project directory and use:
```bash
npm install
```
```bash
npm start
```
This runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

To start the bot in new console go to the bot's directory and use:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```bash
python main.py
```

### Also note that the bot and frontend are not connected in any way, but both of them cannot work without a running backend
